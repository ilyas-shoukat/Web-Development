# Ali's Website

A simple static website created as a starter template.

How to view:

- Open `ali.html` in a browser (or open the folder in Live Server / VS Code Live Preview).

Additional features added:

- An "Apps" grid (Google-style) with links to common Google services and social apps. Replace any placeholder URL with your profile links if you want personal accounts.
- Social links in the footer (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, TikTok, Messenger, Fiverr).
